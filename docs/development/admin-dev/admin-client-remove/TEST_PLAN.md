# Test Plan — ADM-05 Admin — Remove client

## Approach
Tests are written **before** production code (TESTING.md §2). Run them, confirm they fail for the expected reason, then implement.

## Test levels used
- **db** → `supabase/tests/<feature>.test.sql` (pgTAP via `supabase test db`)

## Test cases

| Test ID | Covers | Level | Test description | Written first? | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-01 | AC-01 | db | Given Priya removes Doris, when Banksia carers query Doris, then zero rows are returned. | ☐ | NOT RUN |
| T-02 | AC-02 | db | Given Doris removed, when Tom (family) queries Doris's events, then all events are returned. | ☐ | NOT RUN |

## Regression scope
- Run the full unit/component suite and `supabase test db` before marking READY FOR PR.
- Run Playwright e2e tests for this dashboard before opening the PR.

## Test data
- Use `F0-16` seed data (Banksia Home Care, Margaret, Helen, Aisha R., Priya) unless a test creates its own fixtures.

## Coverage mapping rule
Every AC must have ≥1 test. Tests may only be modified after implementation begins for reasons in TESTING.md §6, recorded in DECISIONS.md.
