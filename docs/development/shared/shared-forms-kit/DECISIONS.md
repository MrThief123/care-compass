## Open decisions affecting this feature

| ID | Decision needed | Blocking? | Proposed default |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-01 | Branch parent and naming for shared (foundation and cross-cutting) work | YES | Option B (recommended): `feature/shared-<name>` branched from `main`, PR → `main` with mandatory human review, then `main` merged into all three dev branches. Option A (strict): host shared work in `family-dev` as `feature/family-shared-<name>` and promote via release. Claude Code must not start any shared feature until this is answered. |
| OQ-10 | Status behaviour and undo | no | Overdue derived when due time passes without Done (not selectable); Done can be undone by the same actor or family via an append-only 'undone' entry. |
| OQ-22 | Event fields | no | Add Title, Start time and Duration fields to the event form (design update). |
| OQ-35 | Settings forms save behaviour | no | Add a Save button per card; Role read-only for carers; email field is contact email only. |
