## Open decisions affecting this feature

| ID | Decision needed | Blocking? | Proposed default |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-01 | Branch parent and naming for shared (foundation and cross-cutting) work | YES | Option B (recommended): `feature/shared-<name>` branched from `main`, PR → `main` with mandatory human review, then `main` merged into all three dev branches. Option A (strict): host shared work in `family-dev` as `feature/family-shared-<name>` and promote via release. Claude Code must not start any shared feature until this is answered. |
| OQ-14 | Carer notifications scope | no | Types: shift assigned/changed/cancelled, family document added, family event added/changed; bell shows unread count and scrolls to the card. |
| OQ-25 | Help tooltips, FAQ and discussion board | no | Parked (PL-05) pending design and priority. |
